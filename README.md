This is a project for [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/nd001) provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). 

In this project, I was provided with a [web-based application that reads RSS feeds](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). I should first explore the application's source code and then exploit [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to write a number of tests against the pre-existing RSS feed application:

* Test whether objects are defined and legal
* Test the default visibility of DOM elements
* Test whether DOM manipulation function works properly in response to mouse click
* Test asynchronous load of Google Feed Reader API 
* Test whether feed switch function works as expected

Click [this link](http://g7845123.github.io/feed-reader) for a online demo of this application. 

All Web sites, books, forums, blog posts, github repositories etc. that I referred to or used are listed in "references.md".
